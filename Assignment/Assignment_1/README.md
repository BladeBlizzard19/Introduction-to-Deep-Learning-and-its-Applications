## Assignment - 1 

This assignment aims to develop a fundamental understanding of Linear Algebra, and Python alongwith some of its libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. 

- Part 1 of the assignment covered the basics of linear algebra such as defining a matrix and some elementary operations such as transpose, dot product, and "complicated multiplication". These concepts were implemented using the numpy library offered by Python.

- Part 2 of the assignment covered the basics of data analysis and data visualisation using Pandas and Matlplotlib. A dataset corresponding to parameters related to houses in different cities was given, and subsequently analysis on this dataset was done.
